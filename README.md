# ECS WASM WebGL Client

Preview: https://WAFFO.github.io

Structured to be as simple as possible to get started. Requires [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) and [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/).

First, build with:

```
$ ./build.sh
```

Then, start server with:

```
$ ./start_server.sh
```

and then visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser! Simple as that!

(If your build asks to update wasm-bindgen-cli, run `update_build.sh` and then build again.)
